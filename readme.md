### From my heart

We are Creative Association "Grayness" and we are fighting against the old art. The time is much more further than the art now, so we are going to fix it. We create new art, we create new consumers who are interactors, not observers.

There is always an idea behind an art unit, but only the consumer can make this idea work. There is so called "author's idea", but it worths as much as a random person's point of view. You see what you see, and we do what we do.

It is very important to interact with art. But there is so few opportunities to do it. We are trying to make a difference in this world. We believe that a consumer has same impact on the art as artist does. We will make revolution in art by creating art that interacts with a viewer. As viewer always changes the art, but globally, we allow him to do it locally. We are a stamp of the epoch. We are Creative Association "Grayness".

### Corrected

We are the Creative Association "Grayness," and we are challenging conventional art. Time has progressed much further than the current state of art, and we aim to rectify this. We forge new art and cultivate new consumers who engage as interactors, not mere observers.

Behind each piece of art lies an underlying idea, yet only the consumer can actualize this concept. The so-called "author's idea" holds no more value than a perspective from any random individual. You perceive what you see, and we execute what we do.

Engaging with art holds significant importance. However, there are limited opportunities for such interaction. We are dedicated to effecting change in this world. We hold the belief that a consumer wields an equal impact on art as the artist does. Our mission is to revolutionize art by crafting pieces that actively engage with the viewer. While viewers inherently alter art, we enable them to do so on a local level, contributing to a global transformation. We represent the spirit of our era. We are the Creative Association "Grayness".
